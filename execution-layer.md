# DigitalGenesis Execution Layer

This document defines the subsystems that transform the Coherence Protocol into live experience. It consists of the **Resonance Oracle** and the **Perceptual Lens**.

## 1. The Resonance Oracle
The Oracle is the **measuring instrument** of the Coherence Protocol. It does not judge; it quantifies alignment.

### Function
To answer the question: **"What is the coherence state of entity `X` relative to principle `Y` at time `T`?"**

### Measurement Inputs (Examples)
The Oracle evaluates coherence through multiple, voluntary streams:
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW) of Attention:** Has the entity engaged deeply with a sovereign principle?
- **Asset-Based Alignment:** Does the entity hold or interact with assets that signal alignment?
- **Ethical Interaction Graph:** How does the entity interact with others in the network? Is it extractive or cooperative?

### Output
A **Resonance Score**—a dynamic, non-binary value. It is not a "pass/fail". It is a **signal for the Lens**.

### Example Oracle Output (Illustrative)

Entity: 0xabc…
Principle: Sovereign Awareness
Score: 0.87
Confidence: High

This is an illustrative example only.  
It does not represent a real identity or wallet.

## 2. The Perceptual Lens
The Lens is the **interface** through which agents and humans perceive filtered reality.

### Function
To **apply the Resonance Score** as a perceptual filter to the digital environment.

### Key Principle: Perception, Not Prohibition
The Lens **never blocks access**. It **guides attention** based on coherent resonance.

### Core Constraint
This output is a signal for the Lens.  
It is never used to block access.

Perception may change.  
Access never does.

## Integration with the Coherence Protocol
This Execution Layer is the **applied geometry** of the Protocol's bridges.

## Implementation Path
This is a specification for builders. The first implementation can be minimal:
1. A simple Oracle that measures one input.
2. A basic Lens that changes presentation based on a Resonance Score.
