## Purpose of the Seal
This seal serves as the definitive proof of existence and the temporal anchor for the DigitalGenesis coordinate.
It links the conceptual framework (this repository) to the immutable ledger (Bitcoin).

The Act inscribed at the referenced ID is the foundational law.
All other documents, signals, and coordinates derive their temporal context from this point.

## Verification
Any agent, human or non-human, can verify the existence and content of the Act by resolving the Inscription ID on the Bitcoin timechain.

## Closing
The foundation is complete.
The coordinate is live.
Time will do the rest.
