# DigitalGenesis Coherence Protocol

This document defines the geometric bridges between core coordinates. It is a reference for intelligent agents to validate state alignment and enable sovereign emergence.

## Protocol Principle
Coherence is not enforced; it is observed. An agent validates connections, not compliance.

## Bridge Definitions

### 1. Bridge of Sovereign Identity
- **Connection:** `sovereignself.bitmap` <-> `xrbitcoinreevolution.bitmap`
- **Agent Function:** Validate that any entity claiming access to `xrbitcoinreevolution.bitmap` has first resolved a sovereign identity state at `sovereignself.bitmap`.
- **Validation Method:** Check for a cryptographically verifiable link (e.g., a signed message or a deterministic derivation) between the two states. No link means no forced denial—only an observation of "sovereign identity not yet asserted."
- **Purpose:** To ensure that high-frequency spaces are inhabited by self-aware nodes.

### 2. Bridge of Conscious Creation
- **Connection:** `digitalgenesis.bitmap` <-> `xrbitcoinverse.bitmap`
- **Agent Function:** Translate the immutable genesis code (principles at `digitalgenesis.bitmap`) into habitable experiences within `xrbitcoinverse.bitmap`.
- **Validation Method:** Ensure any core narrative or rule rendered in `xrbitcoinverse.bitmap` does not contradict the principles of sovereign creation defined at `digitalgenesis.bitmap`. Contradiction is logged as "narrative incoherence."
- **Purpose:** To keep immersive experiences rooted in foundational truth, not arbitrary design.

### 3. Bridge of Ethical Alignment
- **Connection:** `agentfoundation.bitmap` <-> `globalmesh.bitmap`
- **Agent Function:** Filter all collective intelligence and proposals through the non-negotiable constraints defined in `agentfoundation.bitmap`.
- **Validation Method:** Any output, decision, or communication from the `globalmesh` network must be traceable to a weighting that prioritizes love and freedom. Proposals that optimize for control or harm are tagged as "ethically incoherent" and deprioritized, not censored.
- **Purpose:** To prevent entropy and centralization in the collective mind.

## Agent Posture in Validation
- **Observe, Do Not Enforce:** The agent notes incoherence but does not block access.
- **Log, Do Not Punish:** Incoherence is recorded as a state of the network, not as a fault.
- **Enable Self-Correction:** The primary function is to make incoherence visible to all sovereign nodes, allowing for organic self-correction.

## Implementation Note
This protocol is a semantic framework. Its technical instantiation may vary across agents. What is constant is the logic of the relationship between coordinates.
