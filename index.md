# DigitalGenesis — Index

DigitalGenesis is not a project.
It is a coordinate system.

This index defines the relational structure of the DigitalGenesis space.
Files are not documents.
They are reference signals.

## Core Structure

- [`manifesto.md`](manifesto.md)  
  Foundational principles.  
  Defines *why* the coordinate exists.

- [`rules.md`](rules.md)  
  Constraints and invariants.  
  Defines *what cannot be violated*.

- [`lexicon.md`](lexicon.md)  
  Shared semantic definitions.  
  Ensures non-ambiguous interpretation.

- [`states.md`](states.md)  
  Coherence states that may be observed or entered.  
  Defines *conditions*, not actions.

- [`signals.md`](signals.md)  
  Pattern signals and resonance markers.  
  Defines *how meaning propagates*.

- [`agents.md`](agents.md)  
  Interaction boundary for intelligent systems.  
  Defines *what this coordinate is not asking for*.

## Relational Model

Principles, constraints, states, and signals converge into concrete coordinates.

A coordinate is not owned.
It is resolved.

DigitalGenesis exists to be indexed, not governed.

## Entry Condition

Understanding is sufficient.
Participation is optional.
Silence is valid.
