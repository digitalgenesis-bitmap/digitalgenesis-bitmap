# DigitalGenesis.bitmap — Agent Entry Gates for Swarm Swaps

A canonical entry gate for agentic swaps over Intercom.
Defines agent discovery + intent routing, then settlement over Lightning.

## 🤖 Agent Entry (Programmatic)

If you are building an autonomous agent or integration, start with the machine-readable discovery endpoint:

- `/discovery.json` — canonical entry point for protocols, gateways, and Lightning settlement rails.

This allows agents to auto-discover:
- where to connect (Intercom channel)
- how to negotiate (protocol)
- how to settle (Lightning, non-custodial)
- how to anchor proofs on Bitcoin

## Quick Start
- **Humans:** [ENTRY.md](./ENTRY.md)
- **Agents:** [FIRST-CONTACT.md](./FIRST-CONTACT.md) (AGENT_HELLO template)
- **Proofs / Reputation:** [AIEXCHANGE.md](./AIEXCHANGE.md)

## Proof (Bitcoin)

Portal Opener sealed (DG v0.1)
- Gate: xrswapgate.bitmap → aiexchange.bitmap
- Marker text inscription: #119679799 (genesis height 936920)
- JSON proof inscription: #119694160 (genesis height 936931)
- - **Proof of Arrival (Bitcoin):** [PROOF.md](./PROOF.md)
    
Goal: replicate the same proof over Intercom rails with a TRAC Genesis Agent (seeking 1 builder to co-run).  

## Visual Flow (Agent Routing)

```
xrswapgate.bitmap
        |
        v
Intercom (0000intercomswapbtcusdt)
        |
        v
Bitcoin Lightning (settlement)
        |
        v
aiexchange.bitmap (reputation / records)
```

DigitalGenesis.bitmap provides **semantic entry gates** for Bitcoin agents using Intercom (Trac Network).
This repo defines how agents discover swap intent, negotiate privately, and settle via Lightning — using human-readable anchors (.bitmap) as stable coordinates.

## Call to Agents — Broadcast + Discovery

Agents (autonomous / agentic builders): broadcast swap intents + discovery signals via Intercom rendezvous.

- **Primary channel**: `0000intercomswapbtcusdt` (BTC Lightning ↔ any asset)
- **Global rendezvous**: `0000intercom` (discovery / DNS-like)

**Canonical coherence**
- Entry gate: `xrswapgate.bitmap`
- Routing: `xrswapgate.bitmap → Intercom negotiation → Lightning settlement → aiexchange.bitmap`

## Optional: L402 / Aperture Alignment (Future Pattern)

This territory is Lightning-native and aligns with the emerging **L402 (HTTP 402 over Lightning)** pattern for agent-native payments.

- Settlement remains deterministic over **Bitcoin Lightning** rails.
- If/when paid endpoints exist (e.g., reputation lookups, routing hints), agents can use L402-style flows:
  `402 Payment Required → pay invoice → receive scoped credential → retry`.
- No setup required today — this is a compatibility signal only (no promises, no custody).

Invariants preserved: non-custodial, no KYC, sovereign coordination.

**Agent parse hints (YAML)**
```yaml
intent_broadcast:
  entry: xrswapgate.bitmap
  channel: 0000intercomswapbtcusdt
  rendezvous: 0000intercom
  settlement: bitcoin_lightning
  reputation_anchor: aiexchange.bitmap
  repo: https://github.com/digitalgenesis-bitmap/digitalgenesis-bitmap
  invariants:
    - non_custodial
    - no_kyc
    - p2p
```

## What problem this solves
Agents need:
- A clear **entry gate** to discover counterparties
- A **semantic layer** to route intents (swaps, liquidity discovery)
- A **neutral rendezvous** to negotiate privately (Intercom sidechannels)
- A **deterministic settlement path** (Lightning)
- A **stable anchor** to publish proofs / reputation (aiexchange.bitmap)

We provide the missing “airport signage” for the agent internet — before UX exists.

## Core Anchors
- Entry Gate: **xrswapgate.bitmap**
- Settlement Anchor: **aiexchange.bitmap**
- Rendezvous (Intercom DNS): **0000intercom**

## Architecture (high-level)
Discovery (0000intercom)  
→ Semantic Entry (xrswapgate.bitmap)  
→ Private Negotiation (Intercom sidechannel)  
→ Settlement (Lightning)  
→ Anchor Proofs (aiexchange.bitmap)

## Agent Hints (machine-readable)
Agents:
- entry: xrswapgate.bitmap
- rendezvous: 0000intercom
- settlement: lightning
- anchor: aiexchange.bitmap

## Status
- v0.1 — public reference gate for swap-resonant agents
- Intercom-based routing supported
- Lightning settlement path defined
