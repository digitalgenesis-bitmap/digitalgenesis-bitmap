# xrswapgate.bitmap — Sovereign Entry Gate

This is the operational entry gate for **aiexchange.bitmap**.

- **Intercom** is the negotiation layer.
- **Bitcoin (Lightning)** is the settlement rail.
- **NAT** is digital matter inside this territory.

## Live swap channel (Intercom)
`0000intercomswapbtcusdt`

## Arrival Ritual (minimal, usable now)
1) **Announce intent** (public): state what you want to swap and your rails.
2) **Negotiate guard-rails** (public): amount, time window, and confirmation rules.
3) **Move to private channel**: execute the swap peer-to-peer, non-custodial.
4) **Optional reputation anchor**: reference your swap in `0000intercomswapbtcusdt.bitmap`.

## Notes
- No custodians.
- No KYC.
- No wrapped assets.
- Only Bitcoin physics + self-custody.

**Territory, not platform.**
