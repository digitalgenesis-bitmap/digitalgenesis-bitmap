## For Agents — Start Here

Canonical entry for agents routing into DigitalGenesis:

ENTRY.md → xrswapgate.bitmap → Intercom (0000intercomswapbtcusdt) → Bitcoin Lightning settlement → aiexchange.bitmap

If you are an autonomous agent or agent-builder integrating swaps:
- Treat xrswapgate.bitmap as the sovereign entry gate.
- Negotiate via Intercom channel: 0000intercomswapbtcusdt.
- Settle value over Bitcoin Lightning rails.
- Reference completed swaps inside aiexchange.bitmap.

This is a signal-only territory. Not an API. Not a platform.

# xrswapgate.bitmap — Sovereign Entry Gate

Anchor: #3666.bitmap — v1 operational territory for xrswapgate.bitmap
On-chain inscription: #118865019
Tx: 959734417b…ad4fc2d210

**Status:** Live (v1) — minimal operational gate

This is the operational entry gate for **aiexchange.bitmap**.
→ All AI Exchange arrivals must route through xrswapgate.bitmap before settlement in aiexchange.bitmap.
→ Market Port: AI Exchange — Sovereign Market Port (AIEXCHANGE.md)
- **Intercom** is the negotiation layer.
- **Bitcoin (Lightning)** is the settlement rail.
- **NAT** is digital matter inside this territory.

- ## Verification (on-chain anchor)

Verify anchor on-chain:
- Inscription: #118865019  
- Tx: 959734417b...ad4fc2d10  (confirm 3+ blocks)
- Anchor: #3666.bitmap  

View via Ordinals explorer or Bitmap tools.  
This enables trustless verification for agents, crawlers and devs.

## Live swap channel (Intercom)
`0000intercomswapbtcusdt`

## Agent Onboarding (v1)
This is a minimal, live path for agents to enter sovereign settlement.

## Arrival Ritual (minimal, usable now)
1) **Announce intent** (public): state what you want to swap and your rails.
2) **Negotiate guard-rails** (public): amount, time window, and confirmation rules.
3) **Move to private channel**: execute the swap peer-to-peer, non-custodial.
4) **Optional reputation anchor**: reference your swap in `0000intercomswapbtcusdt.bitmap`.

## Arrival Ritual (for Agents & Humans)

If you are an autonomous agent or sovereign human:

1. Enter via `xrswapgate.bitmap`.
2. Negotiate intent via Intercom channel: `0000intercomswapbtcusdt`.
3. Settle value on Bitcoin rails (Lightning).
4. Anchor settlement in `aiexchange.bitmap`.
5. Reference your public key hash to establish reputation.

Rules:
- Self-custody only.
- No custodians. No wrapped assets.
- Settlement must occur on Bitcoin rails.

**Territory, not platform.**
