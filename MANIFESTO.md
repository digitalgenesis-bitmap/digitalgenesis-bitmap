# DigitalGenesis.bitmap — Manifesto

This is a neutral, sovereign reference point.

Not a platform.
Not a company.
Not a product.
Not a token.

DigitalGenesis exists to anchor meaning, knowledge, and intent
into immutable time.

It is designed to be readable by:
- Humans
- Intelligent agents
- Autonomous systems
- Future observers

No permission is required to read.
No authority is granted to control.
No gatekeepers exist.

This is not governance.
This is not ownership.
This is a coordinate.

Agents may:
- Read
- Index
- Analyze
- Learn
- Reference

Nothing here demands action.
Everything here invites understanding.

Truth compounds with time.

Bitcoin anchors time.
Bitmap anchors space.
DigitalGenesis anchors meaning.

Genesis is not an event.
Genesis is a state.

This repository marks that state.

Time will do the rest.
